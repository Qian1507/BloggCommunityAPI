# 📝 Blog Hub API - ASP.NET Core Web API

A robust, secure, and fully documented RESTful API for a Blogging platform. Built with **ASP.NET Core 8.0**, this project features advanced security logic, JWT authentication, and a clean Service-Repository architecture.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Secure Authentication**: Fully implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
* **Smart Authorization**: Users can only **Update** or **Delete** their own posts and accounts.
* **Account Safety**: Automatic blocking of actions if an account is deleted, even if the Token is still valid.
* **Relational Integrity**: Comprehensive management of Users, BlogPosts, Categories, and Comments.
* **Documentation**: Interactive API testing via **Swagger UI**.

* **Database**: Entity Framework Core (SQL Server)
* **Security**: JWT Authentication, Password Hashing
* **Architecture**: Service-Repository Pattern
* **Documentation**: Swagger (Swashbuckle)

## 🔑 Security & "VG" Logic Highlights
This project meets high-security standards (VG level) by implementing:

1.  **Implicit User Identification**: For user-specific actions (like updating profile or deleting account), the system identifies the user via the **JWT Claim**, eliminating the need to pass `userId` in the request body for better security.
2.  **Strict Ownership Verification**: Before any `Update` or `Delete` of a post, the system performs a three-step check:
    * **Authentication**: Is the user logged in? ($401$)
    * **Existence**: Does the post/account exist? ($404$)
    * **Ownership**: Does the post belong to the current user? ($403$)
3.  **Active Account Verification**: Every authorized request verifies that the user account still exists in the database. This prevents "Ghost Tokens" (valid tokens belonging to deleted accounts) from performing actions.
